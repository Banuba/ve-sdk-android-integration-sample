# Banuba AI Video Editor SDK
## Camera screen styles  

- [cameraOverlayStyle](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L17)

    style is intended to **setup action button icons**, customize relative position and appearance of music, gallery, switch camera icons. Icons drawables customized by using custom attributes of this style (for instance, [icon_mask_on](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L205) and [icon_mask_off](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L206) setup drawables for icons related to applied AR mask effect)  
- [cameraActionButtonStyle](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L18)

    style defines action buttons appearance

- [cameraBackButtonStyle](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L20)

- [cameraNextButtonStyle](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L21)

- [cameraRemoveLastPieceButtonStyle](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L22)

    style defines an appearance of the button that is used to delete the last recorded video chunk from the timeline

    If you want to customize your camera screen with the **music icon on the top** of the screen you should:
    - setup [cameraMusicTopIconStyle](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L19) - special style that defines appearance of music icon in case it is placed on the top of the camera screen (if the music icon is placed on the left side the cameraActionButtonStyle is applied to it, so this attribute can be omitted)
    - in `CameraOverlayStyle` sibling set attribute [icon_music_screen_position](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L264) to `top`

- [cameraEffectsLabelStyle](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L25)

    style of the label, which appears at the top of the visual effects menu (color filters and AR masks). By default the label is not visible so this style can be omitted

    style applied to every item within visual effects list
- [cameraEffectsRecyclerStyle](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L27)

    style applied to RecyclerView containing visual effects list
- [cameraSpeedPickerLabelStyle](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L28)

    style is applied to the recording speed options label. By default the label is not visible so this style can be omitted

## String resources

We use 3 grous for all string resources on camera screen:

1. All **action buttons** may have a **text title** (its visibility is configured by *descriptionPosition* attribute of [cameraActionButtonStyle](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L18))

2. **Notification** displayed as [Toast](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Toast) is shown at the top of the screen upon some actions. Some of them has a dynamic message that depends on additional data (i.e. parameters from config files)

3. Bottom view with **AR masks and color filters** may have a **label** (its visibility is configured in [checkableEffectTitleStyle](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L32)

Groups described above are showcasted on the screenshot along with some string resources:

In case if a TextView that are shown on camera has no string resource mentioned here that means you may use any resource from outside the Video Editor SDK and apply it through view's style configuration.

All alert messages shown on the camera screen that require user's action are described in [Alert dialogs](alert_styles.md) section.
