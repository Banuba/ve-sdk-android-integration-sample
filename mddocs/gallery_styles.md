# Banuba AI Video Editor SDK

## Gallery screen configuration

There is a "gallery" section in [**EditorConfig**](./config_videoeditor.md#gallery) class. It has some attributes that impact on gallery screen appearance and logic.

## Gallery screen styles

- [galleryImageViewStyle](../app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L109)

    style defines the overview of gallery icon on the **camera screen**. By default the last media resource is used as gallery icon drawable. To show the custom icon for gallery the `use_custom_image` attribute should be changed to "true" and the custom drawable should be passed as `android:src` value. If there are no media resource on the device the icon from `icon_empty_gallery` attribute of `CameraOverlayView` style is used (if `use_custom_image` is false).

- [galleryBackButtonStyle](../app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L111)

    style for the button placed on the top left corner of the screen. This icon has **two states:** if some files are already selected in the gallery and if nothing is selected. Both states have different drawables that are configured into `VideoCreationTheme` [attributes](../app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L828):

    - `ic_nav_back_arrow` -  nothing is selected → **get back to the previous screen**
    - `ic_nav_close` - some files are selected → **clear selection**
