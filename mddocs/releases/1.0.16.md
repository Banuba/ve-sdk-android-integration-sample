*Released on May 28, 2021*

This release requires prior migration to **1.0.15.1** 

# **Migration guide**

Here is an example of the PR sample for this update: [Pull request](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/pull/90)

## New features

1. Picture in Picture (same as "Duet" on Tiktok). With this feature, the user can shoot his reaction on some video he's excited about. As a result, there'll be two videos in one frame, like this.
   <p align="center">
   <img src="../gif/camera_pip.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="24%" height="auto" class="docs-screenshot"/>&nbsp;
   </p>
   PiP is a premium feature. Ask your account manager on the conditions.
2. Banuba token can now be stored in Firebase. To verify that token is ready, you can use `VideoEditorSDK.isAvailable()`. If method returns true - you can safely launch video editor, otherwise exception is raised.
   [See integration guide](../token_on_firebase.md.md)
3. Gallery screen is sliced from XXX to be a separate module. You can rebuild your own gallery experience and substitute it with our default one, if you want to.
4. Tokens "video_editor_token", "effect_player_token" are now merged into one single "banuba_token" to make it simpler. Ask your account manager to provide new token.
5. Post processing effects was moved to token. Remove editorEffects dependency from `VideoEditorKoinModule`. Also remove `VisualEffects` and `TimeEffects` classes. This effects will be automatically added.
6. Background substitution now also supports video. Previously it was working only with photo.
7. Now you can customize alert dialog styles. [See guide](../alert_styles.md)

# List of changes:

1. Gallery changes:
   - attrubute `galleryChoiceButton` and `GalleryChoiceButtonStyle` are removed
   - New gallery module: Add `implementation "com.banuba.sdk:ve-gallery-sdk:${banubaSdkVersion}"` to gradle dependencies
   - New koin module: add GalleryKoinModule() to koin modules initialization
   - `TrimmerBackButtonStyle` does not use `gallery_icon_back` icon by default now. It must be setup in the style itself. [See example](../../app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L740)
   - attributes `gallery_icon_back` and `gallery_icon_cross` are removed. Now to change back button appearance just put a background on `GalleryBackButtonStyle` as selector where activated state is used for cross icon (to clear selection) and not activated state is for normal back button (to return on previous screen). [See example](../../app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L697)
   - We do not use recyclerview-selection library anymore. So you can safely delete this dependency from your video editor module if you have it.
2. Default style in audio-browser was renamed: `AudioBrowserPlaybackBtnStyle` to `AudioBrowserTrackPlaybackBtnStyle` (to ease the usage)
3. Class `com.banuba.sdk.token.storage.TokenStorageKoinModule` moved to `com.banuba.sdk.token.storage.di.TokenStorageKoinModule`
4. `VideoCreationActivity::buildIntent()` method has changed. You can launch banuba video editor via following methods:
   - For build regular intent:
   ```kotlin
     VideoCreationActivity.buildIntent(
         context: Context,
         additionalExportData: Parcelable?,
         audioTrackData: TrackData?
     )
   ```
   - For build intent with predefined trimmer videos:
   ```kotlin
     VideoCreationActivity.buildPredefinedVideosIntent(
         context: Context,
         predefinedVideos: Array<Uri>,
         additionalExportData: Parcelable?,
         audioTrackData: TrackData?
     )
   ```
   - For build intent with video for pip:
   ```kotlin
     VideoCreationActivity.buildPipIntent(
         context: Context,
         pictureInPictureVideo: Uri,
         additionalExportData: Parcelable?,
         audioTrackData: TrackData?
     )
   ```
5. `MediaSizeProvider` was renamed to `MediaResolutionProvider`. This class now returns `VideoResolution` instead of Size. In `ExportManager.Params.Builder()` you can pass default and optimal videoResolution via `sizeProvider.provideOptimalExportVideoSize()`, or your value from `VideoResolution` enum.
6. `ForegroundExportFlowManager` and `BackgroundExportFlowManager` requires `PublishManager` dependency. Pass publishManager = get() to provide default simple realization. With help of `PublishManager` you can save your videos in native gallery
7. "ar_cloud_client_id" was moved to new token. Remove "ar_cloud_client_id" from string resources and  arEffectsCloudUuid from `VideoEditorKoinModule
8. Optimized masks and effects usage on post processing, became smoother now.
9. Bugfixes.
