# **Migration guide**

Here is an example of the PR sample for this update: [PR sample](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/pull/92)

## New features

1. ### PIP - picture in picture (same as "Duet" on Tiktok).
   With this feature, the user can shoot his reaction on some video he's excited about. As a result, there'll be two videos in one frame, like this.
   <p align="center">
   <img src="../gif/camera_pip.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="24%" height="auto" class="docs-screenshot"/>&nbsp;
   </p>

   To start `BanubaVideoEditor` with an external video use the following  method:
   ```kotlin
     VideoCreationActivity.buildPipIntent(
         context: Context,
         pictureInPictureVideo: Uri,
         additionalExportData: Parcelable?,
         audioTrackData: TrackData?
     )
   ```
   \
   :exclamation: The feature is not available by default. Please contact to Banuba representatives to get more details how to get this feature in your app.
2. ### Token Storage options
   Banuba token can now be stored in Firebase. Please follow this [guide](../token_on_firebase.md)
3. ### Use custom gallery implementation.
   Gallery screen is sliced from XXX to be a separate module. You can rebuild your own gallery experience and substitute it with our default one, if you want to.
4. ### Single Token for Video Editor SDK
   NOW Video Editor SDK uses only one token.\
   We combined Face AR token, video effects token, AR Cloud token, and much more into one single **banuba_token** for simplicity and scalability.\
   Please, contact Banuba representatives to get new token.
5. ### Post processing effects changes
   Post processing effects was moved to new token. Remove editorEffects dependency from `VideoEditorKoinModule`. Also remove `VisualEffects` and `TimeEffects` classes.\
   This effects will be automatically added.
6. ### Background substitution with video
   Background substitution now also supports video. Previously it was working only with photo.
7. ### Alert styles
   Now you can customize alert dialog styles. [See guide](../alert_styles.md)

## List of changes:

1. #### Gallery changes:
   - attrubute `galleryChoiceButton` and `GalleryChoiceButtonStyle` are removed
   - New gallery module: Add `implementation "com.banuba.sdk:ve-gallery-sdk:${banubaSdkVersion}"` to gradle dependencies
   - New koin module: add GalleryKoinModule() to koin modules initialization
   - `TrimmerBackButtonStyle` does not use `gallery_icon_back` icon by default now. It must be setup in the style itself. [See example](../../app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L740)
   - attributes `gallery_icon_back` and `gallery_icon_cross` are removed. Now to change back button appearance just put a background on `GalleryBackButtonStyle` as selector where activated state is used for cross icon (to clear selection) and not activated state is for normal back button (to return on previous screen). [See example](../../app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L697)
   - We do not use recyclerview-selection library anymore. So you can safely delete this dependency from your video editor module if you have it.
2. Default style in audio-browser was renamed: `AudioBrowserPlaybackBtnStyle` to `AudioBrowserTrackPlaybackBtnStyle` (to ease the usage)
3. Class `com.banuba.sdk.token.storage.TokenStorageKoinModule` moved to `com.banuba.sdk.token.storage.di.TokenStorageKoinModule`
4. `VideoCreationActivity::buildIntent()` method has changed.\
   [See guide](../launch_modes.md) to get more information.
5. `MediaSizeProvider` was renamed to `MediaResolutionProvider`. This class now returns `VideoResolution` instead of Size.\
   In `ExportManager.Params.Builder()` you can pass default and optimal videoResolution via `sizeProvider.provideOptimalExportVideoSize()`, or your value from `VideoResolution` enum.
6. `ForegroundExportFlowManager` and `BackgroundExportFlowManager` requires `PublishManager` dependency. Pass publishManager = get() to provide default simple realization.\
   With help of `PublishManager` you can save your videos in native gallery
7. "ar_cloud_client_id" was moved to new token.\
   Remove "ar_cloud_client_id" from string resources and  arEffectsCloudUuid from `VideoEditorKoinModule
8. Optimized masks and effects usage on post processing, became smoother now.
9. Bugfixes.
