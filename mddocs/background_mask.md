# Background mask integration

## Overview

Background mask is an AR effect that allows to apply images or videos as a background during recording video.

To use the Background effect in an app, please, request it from Banuba representatives.

## Integration

### Step 1

 - If you use [AR cloud](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample#Connecting-with-AR-cloud), the Background effect is available for you to download right from the AR masks list on the Camera screen.

 - If you store AR effects internally, request the mask from Banuba representatives and place it into assets/bnb-resources/effects folder of your app.

 ### Step 2

 Add theme attributes with your custom [styles](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L1112) mentioned in Customization section.

## Customization

Background mask is provided with additional UI that helps to select required media file. UI is customized by [main theme attributes](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml#L352) like any other Video Editor SDK screens.
